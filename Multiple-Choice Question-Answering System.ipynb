This suggests that the set similarity measures might be capturing more nuanced relationships between questions and options compared to TF vectors.\n",

While TF vectors and cosine similarity provide a straightforward approach, set similarity measures might be more suitable for capturing semantic similarity between textual data in this specific task of multiple-choice question answering.\n",

        "Set Similarity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sensitivity to Tokenization: Set similarity methods rely heavily on tokenization, where each word/token is treated as an independent entity. This can lead to issues with ambiguity, especially in cases where the same word can have multiple meanings.\n",
        "Limited Semantic Understanding: Set similarity methods do not consider the semantic relationships between words or tokens. They treat each token independently and do not capture the contextual meaning of the text.\n",
        "Difficulty Handling Synonyms and Paraphrases: Set similarity methods may struggle to detect similarity between sentences containing synonyms or paraphrases. Since they rely solely on token overlap, sentences with similar meanings but different wordings may not be recognized as similar.\n",
        "Cosine Similarity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Dependency on Vector Representations: Cosine similarity requires vector representations of text, such as TF-IDF vectors or word embeddings. These representations may not capture all aspects of semantic similarity, leading to inaccuracies.\n",
        "Difficulty with Rare Words and Out-of-Vocabulary Terms: Cosine similarity is based on the vector space model, which represents words as vectors. Rare words or out-of-vocabulary terms may not have accurate vector representations, leading to difficulties in measuring similarity.\n",
        "Ignorance of Word Order: Cosine similarity treats documents as bags of words, ignoring the order of words. While this can be beneficial in some cases (e.g., document classification), it may not be suitable for tasks where word order is essential, such as understanding the context of a sentence.\n",
        "Overall, while set similarity and cosine similarity methods are simple and computationally efficient, they may not capture the nuances of semantic similarity effectively. In tasks requiring a deeper understanding of language semantics and context, more advanced techniques such as neural embeddings or contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT) may be more appropriate."

Consequently, the model's output logits are optimized for this purpose, potentially yielding superior performance compared to employing the [CLS] vector, which may lack specific optimization for this task.\n",

These learned representations are apt to encapsulate more nuanced information concerning the relationship between the question and each answer option, resulting in more precise predictions compared to relying on a single representation (e.g., the [CLS] vector) for the entire sequence.\n",
